This project is a content-based Movie Recommendation System developed using Python and 
the TMDB dataset. It recommends similar movies based on a user’s selection by analyzing 
movie features such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview. The system uses machine learning 
techniques with cosine similarity and stores preprocessed data and similarity matrices using
pickle files for faster execution. The project is implemented in PyCharm using popular
Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, and is designed to be simple, efficient,
and easily extendable for future enhancements such as web deployment or API integration
