It’s a JavaScript digital clock that updates every second.

The time is fetched using new Date().

It converts 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM.

Leading zeros are added if hours, minutes, or seconds are less than 10.

The time is displayed in an HTML element with the class .clock.

setInterval(runClock, 1000) ensures the clock refreshes every second.

So overall, the code continuously displays the current time in HH : MM : SS AM/PM format inside the webpage.
